# Food Shocks Cascade Model
- A simple agent-based network model that computes chain-reactions due to production anomalies based on dynamic food balance sheets at the country level.
- Development version of the model introduced and described in Heslin, A., M.J. Puma, P. Marchand, J.A. Carr, J. Dell'Angelo, P. D'Odorico, J.A. Gephart, M. Kummu, M. Porkka, M.C. Rulli, D. Seekell, S. Suweis, and A. Tavoni, 2020: Simulating the cascading effects of an extreme agricultural production shock: Global implications of a contemporary US Dust Bowl event. Front. Sustain. Food Syst., 20 March 2020, doi:10.3389/fsufs.2020.00026.
- Earlier model version is available at https://github.com/pmarchand1/cereals-network-shocks and described in the paper: Marchand, P., J.A. Carr, J. Dell'Angelo, M. Fader, J.A. Gephard, M. Kummu, N.R. Magliocca, M. Porkka, M.J. Puma, and Z. Ratajczak, 2016: Reserves and trade jointly determine exposure to food supply shocks. Environ. Res. Lett., 11, no. 9, 095009, doi:10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/095009.

## How to setup and run the model
### Step 1: Clone repository
To run a simulation, first clone this repository and navigate to the top-level directory with:
```
git clone git@github.com:mjpuma/FSC-WorldModelers.git
cd FSC-WorldModelers
```

### Step 2: Pull raw input files
```
cd inputs
wget 'http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Trade_DetailedTradeMatrix_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip'
wget 'http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Production_Crops_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip'
wget 'https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/downloads/psd_grains_pulses_csv.zip'

unzip 'Trade_DetailedTradeMatrix_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip'
unzip 'Production_Crops_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip'
unzip 'psd_grains_pulses_csv.zip'
```

### Step 3: Install the required R Packages
```
rscript main/Requirements.R
```

### Step 4: Prepare the input data
```
rscript main/ProcessInputs.R
```

### Step 5: Run a simulation
To run a simulation you need to specify 1) the version of the FSC, 2) the crop or set of commodity (aggregated) to simulation, and 3) the number of time steps (annual) to run.

* `FSCversion`: Specify model version to run: 0-> Run Proportional Trade Allocation (PTA) version; 
                                              1-> Run Reserves-based Trade Allocation (RTA) version
* `i_scenario`:  i_scenario -> 1 # wheat; i_scenario -> 2 # rice; i_scenario -> 3 # maize
* `num_years`: number of time steps to run consecutively (time size = 1 year) 

You can run a dynamic simulation with something like the following:
```
rscript main/main.R 0 1 5
```
In this case, we have chosen the following parameters:

* `FSCversion`: 0 -> RTA version of the FSC moodel
* `i_scenario`: 1 -> wheat commoditites
* `num_years`: 5 years

## Summary of Model Scripts
### main.R
This is the main script for running the *dynamic* FSC from the command line including time loop and reading of processed inputs and saving of outputs.

### main_static.R
This is the main script for running the *static* FSC from the command line.  This script simply computes changes in supply by country due to production decline anomalies (as a country list).

### ProcessInputs.R
Creates trade, production, and reserves matrices for use in the FSC model. 
Requires existing files in *ancillary* and *inputs* directory.  Processed inputs are saved and subsequently accessed by main.R or main_static.R in a separate folder called *inputs_processed*
#### Ancillary files
- country_list195_2012to2016.csv = FAO country code, iso3 abbreviation, and full country names
- cropcommodity_tradelist.csv = Commodity list for *bilateral trade* with kcal conversions
- cropcommodity_prodlist.csv = Commodity list for *production* with kcal conversions
- cropcommodity_reserveslist.csv = Commodity list for *reserves* with kcal conversions

#### Input files
- Production *fractional declines* list by year by country. List depends on ancillary country list file. anomalies <- read.csv(paste0("inputs/Prod", name_crop, "_DeclineFraction_195countries.csv"))
- Trade data from FAOSTAT, detailed trail matrix, normalized, all data. The trade matrix is available here - http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TM - on the right side bar under "Bulk Downloads", select "All Data Normalized".   *trade_dat <- read.csv("Trade_DetailedTradeMatrix_E_All_Data_(Normalized).csv"*
- Production data from FAOSTAT, production quantity in tonnes. The crop production data are available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC. *prod_dat<-read.csv("productiondataFAOSTAT.csv")*
- Reserves data from USDA, downloadable dataset - psd grains pulses. The stocks data are available here - https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/downloads - listed as "Grains" the file is called "psd_grains_pulses_csv.zip". *psd <- read.csv("psd_grains_pulses.csv")*

#### Processed input files
- Export Matrix ordered by FAOSTAT country code (increasing). *load("inputs_processed/E0.RData")*
- Production. *load("inputs_processed/P0.Rdata")* 
- Reserves. (a.k.a. Stocks) *load("inputs_processed/R0.RData")*

## Model Vignette
- CODE: Written in R
- INPUT (required): Bilateral trade of commodities at country level, production/consumption/storage for all countries
- INPUT (ancillary): Commodity list, country list, conversion factors from commodity mass to common units (e.g. kcal, protein, US dollars)
- OUTPUT: Changes in stocks and consumption at country level
- RUNTIME: Preprossesing input data takes roughtly 5 minutes; cascade simulations roughtly a few minutes on desktop computer
- RESOLUTION: annual food balances; country level
